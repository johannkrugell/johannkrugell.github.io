I"Ô<p>In the din and stink that is Cannery Row a colourful blend of misfits â€“ gamblers, whores, drunks, bums, and artists â€“ survive side by side in a jumble of adventure and mischief. Doc, who owns the laboratory, is the fount of all generosity and wisdom. Everybody wants to do something nice for Doc: the trouble is, he always ends up paying. Packed with invention and joie de vivre, Cannery Row is Steinbeckâ€™s high-spirited tribute to his native California.</p>
